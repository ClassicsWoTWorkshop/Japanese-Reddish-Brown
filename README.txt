Thank you for downloading!

This mod changes the color of the Japanese tanks from their default green to a reddish-brown color, inspired by the pre-release color from the 0.8.10 Common Test.
Includes skin for all Japanese tanks, matching icons for the garage and tech tree, two optional flag change mods, and support for my Dakka Improvement Project.



To install:
- Drop the "CWW-RecolorPack-Japanese-Reddish-Brown" folder from inside the "MAIN MOD - COLOR CHANGE" folder into <Your WoT Directory\mods\<Game Version> (example: C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\mods\1.9.1.2).



<<<IMPORTANT NOTE FOR DAKKA PROJECT USERS>>> 
- If you want this pack to display correctly with my Dakka Improvement Project pack, you will need to drag the "vehicles" folder from inside "ADDON - DAKKA PROJECT SUPPORT" folder to <Your WoT Install>\RES_mods\<Game Version>. (Example: C:\Games\World_Of_Tanks\res_mods\1.9.1.2)



Optional:
- If you want to also change the default Japanese flag emblems, drag the "mods" folder from inside the "ADDON - FLAG CHANGE" folder of your choice to <Your WoT Directory>\mods\<Game Version> (Example: C:\Games\World_Of_Tanks\mods\1.9.1.2). Preview images are included in each folder.



Enjoy!
