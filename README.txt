Thank you for downloading!

This mod changes the color of the HD Japanese tanks from their default green to a beige/sandy color, inspired by the pre-release colors.
Included are skins for all the HD Japanese tanks, matching icons for the garage and tech tree, and an optional flag change mod.

To install:
- Drag the files from inside the MAIN MOD - COLOR CHANGE folder to your World of Tanks install directory (by default, C:\Games\World_of_Tanks).
Optional:
- If you want to also change the default Japanese flag (edit: might not be completely historical, but I still like it), drag the "res_mods" folder from inside the ADDON - FLAG CHANGE folder to your World of Tanks install directory as well.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Only the tanks that are currently in HD have the color swap. The non-HD tanks still have their default green color. Since WG is going to rework them into HD at some point anyways, I'd rather not have to re-do the mod twice for those tanks. Plus, the color shows up weird since they use the old model/texture system.

I included preview images in the download ZIP file for both if you'd like to have a look before you install.

Enjoy!
