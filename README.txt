Thank you for downloading!

This mod changes the color of the HD Japanese tanks from their default green to a beige/sandy color, inspired by the pre-release colors.
Included are skins for all the HD Japanese tanks, matching icons for the garage and tech tree, and two optional flag change mods.

To install:
- Drag the files from inside the MAIN MOD - COLOR CHANGE folder to <Your WoT Install Directory>\res_mods\<version> (example: C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\res_mods\0.9.20.0).
Optional:
- If you want to also change the default Japanese flag (which might not be completely historical, but I still like it), drag the "res_mods" folder from inside the ADDON - FLAG CHANGE folder of your choice to <Your WoT Folder>\mods\<Game Version> (Example: C:\Games\World_Of_Tanks\mods\0.9.19.0.2). I included preview images for each flag, so you can see what to expect.

Enjoy!
